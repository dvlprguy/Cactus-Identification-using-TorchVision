# Cactus-Identification-using-TorchVision

Link to Kaggle Contest: https://www.kaggle.com/c/aerial-cactus-identification

I used torchvision and a basic cnn to produce the labels.
Pretty basic task to get started with pytorch...
Will implement the same task with Julia someday...
The dataset is very well curated and can be used for GANs too.
